## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to check the current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. It utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and `localStorage` for storing persistent data. Users can search for a city, view current weather conditions, a 5-day forecast, and access a search history feature.
